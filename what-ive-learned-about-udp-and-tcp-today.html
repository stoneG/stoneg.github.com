</footer><!-- /.post-info -->      <p>User Datagram Protocol (UDP) is a type of internet protocol that is well
suited for sending no more than a few one-time packets. There is no
handshake process, and all forms of communication must be built into the
client and server sides respectively. Generally processes that utilize
the UDP structure accept that packets may be lost in delivery or
translation and prefer lost data over delayed data. Usually these are
applications that run on real-time such as multiplayer games (where itâ€™s
okay to skip a frame since your next packet will place you in the right
spot) or streaming media (better to get a hiccup than random sound clips
out of place). Also, UDP gives way to a fancy ability called
broadcasting, which allows you to blast a local network with the same
packet all at once. This is good for updating some applications that
should be synced up over the network.</p>
<p>Transmission Control Protocol (TCP) is a type of internet protocol that
is well suited for sending reliable, streams of data in an established
connection between server and client. Before any data is transferred, a
handshake must be completed between server and client. This is called
the SYN, SYN-AWK, AWK process, where the client will send a SYNchronize
packet to the server, the server will receive the packet and send back a
SYNchronize-ACKnowledgement to the client, and the client will confirm
the ACKnowledgement back to the server. This process establishes the
connection between server and client on the specified ports. Data is
then transferred around in multiple bursts, which is why TCP is not used
by applications sending one-time information. Packets may still be lost,
but the receiving party will determine if this happens and send
re-transmission requests to the sender and reassemble the full structure
of the packets later. If there is a lot of congestion in the data stream
and the server cannot handle requests quickly enough, TCP applications
will generally practice some prudence in sending future packets -
limiting the rate of transmission as congestion occurs. The majority of
network applications use follow the TCP structure.</p>
