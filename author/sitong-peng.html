        <article>
            <p>Last year I had the chance to take some time and get a better understanding of how push notifications work for iOS applications. But before I talk about that, it helps to understand why push notifications exist in the first place.</p>
<p>Apple developed iOS as a closed platform operating system. The source code is mostly closed except for the publicly available portions that developers use in networking programming or to interface with the camera or all the other fancy things that apps do. One of the most important design decisions made at Apple was to heavily restrict the capabilities of daemonized apps (apps running in the background). In fact, Apple's guidelines explicitly state that only apps such as music players, VoIP clients, and GPS navigation systems are allowed to run background tasks. That essentially means that once a user leaves your app, you're dead in the water until the user decides to tap your lovely retina icon again... at least that would have been the case if it weren't for push notifications.</p>
<p>Push notifications exist for the express purpose of letting applications pull users back into their experience. They're basically shouting "Hey, look at me, I have something to show you!"</p>
<p>The life of a push notification starts on an application. The application will ask iOS for a unique device token that identifies the device, sort of like an IP address. As you'd imagine, it's pretty important to know the address of the device you want to send something to. The operating system doesn't have this information regularly, it actually makes a request to the Apple Push Notification Service (APNS), which divulges a unique token for that specific iOS build on that specific device. The application should then pass the token to its backend server (this is the thing that I've been working on at <a href="https://www.myeatclub.com">EAT Club</a>).</p>
<p>Once you want to send a push notification to a specific user (for instance, a "Your food is ready for pickup!" notification that we send to users who have ordered a meal that day), just pluck that device token out of your database table and pass it to your push server to fire off to APNS. There are also third parties that exist as the middle man push server between your backend servers and APNS (see UrbanAirship). While it would be awesome if we could build servers that directly sent out pushes to iOS devices, Apple unfortunately maintains ultimate gatekeeper status and all your push notification requests must be routed through APNS. Such is the plight of developing on a closed source platform.</p>
<p>Then if all is fine and dandy, APNS will send your push to the user's device - along with a custom sound (i.e. the Gmail app), custom alert text, and even let you specify where the user lands when they open the notification (i.e. opening up the Twitter app and immediately dropping you on the tweet that just mentioned your handle).</p>

        <p class="date">Wednesday, January 30, 2013</p>        </header>
        <article>
            <p>So while I was working on interview prep, I got a bit curious about what cool ways bit manipulation might alter the way we might write code. Here's a few examples of short functions you can write using only bit operations.</p>
<h2>Simple stuff first</h2>
<p>The following trick may be standard fare but seeing as I am not a "classically" trained programmer (no degree in computer science), this guy did tickle my fancy.</p>
<p>When you write out a integer in a binary representation, 5 as <code>0101</code> for example, the least significant bit (leftmost bit) represents if the integer is odd or even. Of course, bits further left represent powers of two, hence the term "base two".</p>
<div class="codehilite"><pre>0101 <span class="n">is</span> 0<span class="o">*</span><span class="p">(</span>2^3<span class="p">)</span> <span class="o">+</span> 1<span class="o">*</span><span class="p">(</span>2^2<span class="p">)</span> <span class="o">+</span> 0<span class="o">*</span><span class="p">(</span>2^1<span class="p">)</span> <span class="o">+</span> 1<span class="o">*</span><span class="p">(</span>2^0<span class="p">)</span>
     <span class="n">or</span> 0<span class="o">*</span>8 <span class="o">+</span> 1<span class="o">*</span>4 <span class="o">+</span> 0<span class="o">*</span>2 <span class="o">+</span> 1<span class="o">*</span>1
     <span class="n">or</span> 5
</pre></div>


<p>Anyone can write a simple function that tests if a given integer <code>x</code> is even. Usually it will involve checking to see if <code>x</code> mod 2 is 0.</p>
<div class="codehilite"><pre><span class="k">def</span> <span class="nf">is_even</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">x</span><span class="p">):</span>
    <span class="k">return</span> <span class="p">(</span><span class="n">x</span> <span class="o">%</span> <span class="mi">2</span><span class="p">)</span> <span class="o">==</span> <span class="mi">0</span>
</pre></div>


<p>But, given that least significant bit of a binary value represents odd or even, we can write that same <code>is_even</code> function using the <code>AND</code> bit operation. </p>
<div class="codehilite"><pre><span class="k">def</span> <span class="nf">is_even</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">x</span><span class="p">):</span>
    <span class="k">return</span> <span class="p">(</span><span class="n">x</span> <span class="o">&amp;</span> <span class="mi">1</span><span class="p">)</span> <span class="o">==</span> <span class="mi">0</span>
</pre></div>


<p>For example 6 &amp; 1 is 0.</p>
<div class="codehilite"><pre>  <span class="m">0110</span>  <span class="o">&lt;--</span> <span class="m">6</span>
<span class="o">&amp;</span> <span class="m">0001</span>  <span class="o">&lt;--</span> <span class="m">1</span>
<span class="o">======</span>
  <span class="m">0000</span>
</pre></div>


<p>This ends up being the same amount of typing but it's interesting that we have this second option of writing the <code>is_even</code> function.</p>
<h2>Powerful twos</h2>
<p>If you work on <a href="http://projecteuler.net/">Project Euler</a> problems frequently, the following shortcut might be beneficial to keep in mind. Here's a function that checks if <code>x</code> is a power of two.</p>
<div class="codehilite"><pre><span class="k">def</span> <span class="nf">is_power_of_two</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">x</span><span class="p">):</span>
    <span class="n">power_of_two</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="mi">2</span>
    <span class="k">while</span> <span class="n">power_of_two</span> <span class="o">&lt;</span> <span class="n">x</span><span class="p">:</span>
        <span class="n">power_of_two</span> <span class="o">*=</span> <span class="mi">2</span>
    <span class="k">return</span> <span class="n">power_of_two</span> <span class="o">==</span> <span class="n">x</span>
</pre></div>


<p>That's pretty compact but it turns out binary is well suited to figure out if a number is a power of two.</p>
<div class="codehilite"><pre><span class="k">def</span> <span class="nf">is_power_of_two</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">x</span><span class="p">):</span>
    <span class="k">return</span> <span class="p">(</span><span class="n">x</span> <span class="o">&amp;</span> <span class="p">(</span><span class="n">x</span><span class="o">-</span><span class="mi">1</span><span class="p">))</span> <span class="o">==</span> <span class="mi">0</span>
</pre></div>


<p>Let's see this in action with <code>x</code> as some random binary number:</p>
<div class="codehilite"><pre>  <span class="m">010110000</span>  <span class="o">&lt;--</span> x
<span class="o">-</span> <span class="m">000000001</span>
<span class="o">===========</span>
  <span class="m">010101111</span>  <span class="o">&lt;--</span> x<span class="o">-</span><span class="m">1</span>
<span class="o">&amp;</span> <span class="m">010110000</span>
<span class="o">===========</span>
  <span class="m">010100000</span>  <span class="o">&lt;--</span> x <span class="o">&amp;</span> <span class="p">(</span>x<span class="o">-</span><span class="m">1</span><span class="p">)</span>

So<span class="p">,</span> <span class="p">(</span>x <span class="o">&amp;</span> <span class="p">(</span>x<span class="o">-</span><span class="m">1</span><span class="p">))</span> just removed the left<span class="o">-</span>most bit that was equal to <span class="m">1.</span> But then<span class="p">,</span> when might <span class="p">(</span>x <span class="o">&amp;</span> <span class="p">(</span>x<span class="o">-</span><span class="m">1</span><span class="p">))</span> be <span class="m">0</span>? That would only happen when x has only one <span class="m">1</span> bit<span class="p">,</span> which means that x must be a power of <span class="m">2.</span>
</pre></div>


<h2>Swapping in place</h2>
<p>Python is nice in that you never have to use a temporary variable when you want to do variable swaps. This is, of course, not the same in other languages.</p>
<div class="codehilite"><pre><span class="n">x</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="n">y</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="n">y</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="n">x</span>
</pre></div>


<p>Behind the scenes, Python accesses the values of <code>y</code> and <code>x</code>, then rotates them as it unpacks and assigns to <code>x</code> and <code>y</code>. Here's what that looks like when run through the Python disassembler:</p>
<div class="codehilite"><pre><span class="kn">import</span> <span class="nn">dis</span>

<span class="k">def</span> <span class="nf">func</span><span class="p">():</span>
    <span class="n">a</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="mi">1</span>
    <span class="n">b</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="mi">2</span>
    <span class="n">a</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="n">b</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="n">a</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="n">b</span>
    <span class="n">a</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="n">b</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="n">b</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="n">a</span>

<span class="n">dis</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">dis</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">func</span><span class="p">)</span>
<span class="o">&gt;</span>
<span class="o">&gt;</span>  <span class="mi">3</span>           <span class="mi">0</span> <span class="n">LOAD_CONST</span>               <span class="mi">1</span> <span class="p">(</span><span class="mi">1</span><span class="p">)</span>

</pre></div>


<p>But, did you know we can actually swap without a temporary variable using <code>XOR</code> too.</p>
<div class="codehilite"><pre><span class="n">x</span> ^<span class="p">=</span> <span class="n">y</span>
<span class="n">y</span> ^<span class="p">=</span> <span class="n">x</span>
<span class="n">x</span> ^<span class="p">=</span> <span class="n">y</span>
</pre></div>


<p>To understand what's happening, you should recall that <code>XOR</code> is commutative, <code>x^x</code> is 0, and <code>x^0</code> is <code>x</code>. Let's break down the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/XOR_swap_algorithm">XOR Swap Algorithm</a> again.</p>
<div class="codehilite"><pre><span class="gh">start   -&gt;  breaking down  -&gt;  commuting      -&gt;  cancelling -&gt;  removing 0&#39;s</span>
<span class="gh">=============================================================================</span>
x ^= y  -&gt;  x = x^y
y ^= x  -&gt;  y = y^x^y      -&gt;  y = x^y^y      -&gt;  y = x^0    -&gt;  y = x
x ^= y  -&gt;  x = x^y^y^x^y  -&gt;  x = x^x^y^y^y  -&gt;  x = 0^y^0  -&gt;  x = y
</pre></div>


<p>That's pretty cool but I'll stick to Python's easy swap. It is nice, however, to see how binary manipulation can be used to our advantage in languages that don't have an in-place swap.</p>
<p>Now for the disclaimer. While the XOR swap is pretty nifty, it doesn't have much practical use. If you actually plan on using it in the real world, hopefully your application fits in one of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/XOR_swap_algorithm#Reasons_for_use_in_practice">these</a> buckets. Turns out, optimizing compilers tend to make temporary variable swaps pretty efficient, often faster than this XOR swap.</p>

<ol>
<li>Ship something in virtual reality.</li>
<li>Write 8 posts worthy of reading.</li>
<li>Hike at two national parks, preferably new.</li>
<li>Live in a foreign country that's new to me.</li>
<li>Develop a fluidity in the kitchen so most dishes I make are served on time.</li>
<li>Be able to name all common herbs &amp; spices by sight &amp; smell.</li>
<li>Accomplish at least two physical goals for surfing, snowboarding, skiing, or weightlifting.</li>

<p><img alt="Toronto at night" src="https://raw.github.com/stoneG/stoneg.github.com/master/images/toronto.jpg" /></p>
<p><strong>You</strong>, the pakistani man who makes butter chicken roti at your strangely NYC themed restaurant, who passably decorated it by throwing up old LIFE magazine covers on the walls, who has family trouble in California and a cousin doing a stint in our penal system.</p>
<p><strong>You</strong>, the pupusa lady that gave me an extra tamale on the house after I had such a hard time deciding which pupusas and tamale flavors I wanted to try, who then laughed when I immediately came back to order the fried plantains, which I saw while waiting for my order (they weren't on the menu I agonized over).</p>
<p><strong>You</strong>, the guy bumping to <em>Hotline Bling</em> outside your car that I grooved with, but politely had to decline your offer of a cigarette, because I had gone through D.A.R.E. three times as a kid.</p>
<p><strong>You</strong>, the roommate who was once a kingpin of street fighter arcade sticks as well as an elite Canadian memory champion, who is unfazed by face transplant images that made me jump out of my chair, who upon learning I was leaving Toronto without seeing Niagara Falls rented a car and drove us out there at midnight.</p>
<p><strong>You</strong>, the roommate who is a sound mixing engineer that did a tour of duty in Nashville but somehow managed to work on rock instead of country, who showed me the process for modern sound mixing using Britney Spears’ <em>I'm a Slave For You</em> (dozens of vocal tracks!), who stood in the hallway with me until 3am because we had delved too deep into our opinions about movies &amp; games for sleep to matter anymore.</p>
<p><strong>You</strong>, the roommate who is polyglot that’s lived in many different countries, who works harder to balancing work and school than most anyone I've met, who still had the energy to unabashedly start dancing the one time I casually panned you into my snapchat video.</p>
<p><strong>You</strong>, the girl with an excitement that is palpable, contagious, and hard to forget, who unquestioningly shared your hopes and dreams to a complete stranger who slid into your DMs, who despite living there your whole life, seemed somehow less familiar with directions in Toronto than me.</p>
<p><strong>You</strong>, the guy who has not ventured out of Montreal for over 35 years, but gave me change for the bus and humored me while I chatted you up about how your city's bagels had ruined me for life.</p>
<p><strong>You all made me feel odd, like I was leaving a place that had become a home.</strong></p>
<p>Sincerely,</p>
<p>Confused in California.</p>

            <p>There comes a point, usually after you've been using something for awhile, when you realize you are no longer just using it casually. <strong><em>And no, I'm not talking about drugs.</em></strong>I'm talking about defining my first shortcut key in my <code>.vimrc</code>.</p>
<h2>A little background</h2>
<p>I was first introduced to <a href="http://www.vim.org/">Vim</a> by my <a href="http://www.hackerschool.com">Hacker School</a> buddy <a href="http://www.jamesshieh.com">James</a>. For those of you who don't know, Vim is a very peculiar text editor. It is an "improved" version of <a href="http://ex-vi.sourceforge.net/">Vi</a>, the de facto Unix editor. Vim allows for a very efficient coding experience in which your hands generally never have to leave their main resting positions on the keyboard. And unlike editors (see <a href="http://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/">Emacs</a>), Vim makes heavy usage of different input modes to separate document navigation, inserting content, and text selection. This makes for a steep initial learning curve, as the default mode in Vim is mostly navigational, which is a farcry from the style of most word processors (hjkl actually mean hjkl, not left down up right).</p>
<h2>Word Wrap</h2>
<p>So I was excited to be able to write these blog posts using Vim since I've gotten quite good and fast at using it. However, I quickly realized that a text editor that primarily displays lines of code needs a bit of work to properly display words and sentences.</p>
<p>For instance, here's what I was seeing everytime I wrote a paragraph of text:</p>
<div class="codehilite"><pre>This is a medium paragraph of text. Everything is all fine and dandy until you
 get to the end of the line. Then, whatever text you just wrote gets cut off p
recisely when you reach the column width of your Vim window. This leads to awk
ward and hard to read paragraphs!
</pre></div>


<p>So, after a bit of research, I threw this into my <code>.vimrc</code> file.</p>
<div class="codehilite"><pre><span class="c">&quot; F5 word wrap mode (great for writing blog posts!)</span>
<span class="k">set</span> <span class="nb">wrap</span>
<span class="nb">nnoremap</span> <span class="p">&lt;</span>F5<span class="p">&gt;</span> :<span class="k">set</span> <span class="nb">linebreak</span><span class="p">&lt;</span>CR<span class="p">&gt;</span>
<span class="nb">nnoremap</span> <span class="p">&lt;</span>C<span class="p">-</span>F5<span class="p">&gt;</span> :<span class="k">set</span> <span class="nb">nolinebreak</span><span class="p">&lt;</span>CR<span class="p">&gt;</span>
</pre></div>


<p>The first line turns the <code>wrap</code> option on. The second line binds <code>:set linebreak&lt;CR&gt;</code> to <code>F5</code> in normal mode. The last line binds the reverse to <code>Ctrl</code> + <code>F5</code>. <code>&lt;CR&gt;</code> is a carriage return, otherwise known as the <code>enter</code> or <code>return</code> button.</p>
<p>So hitting <code>F5</code> in normal mode effectively types out <code>:set linebreak</code> then hits <code>enter</code> for you, rendering much more readable text for when you are not just writing code!</p>
<div class="codehilite"><pre>This is a medium paragraph of text. Everything is all fine and dandy until
you get to the end of the line. Then, whatever text you just wrote gets cut
off precisely when you reach the column width of your Vim window. This
leads to awkward and hard to read paragraphs!
</pre></div>


<p><span id="note">For those of you that are curious, Vim will automatically break the line as soon as it encounters any of these characters <code>^I !@*-+;:,./?</code>. You can change that default by redefining the <code>breakat</code> option. See <a href="http://vim.wikia.com/wiki/Word_wrap_without_line_breaks">here</a> for details.</span></p>
