            <p>Before I release the 2016 ones, here are my last set of resolutions from <a href="/posts/programming-resolutions.html">2013</a>:</p>
<p class="quote">"100 posts about programming things I’ve encountered and want to share"</p>

<p>Rode the new years train a bit too hard on this one. Even without life getting in the way, this would have been a tough one to keep, but glad I managed even 14 posts even if 13 came in the first half of the year.</p>
<p class="quote">"Contribute a couple patches or a bug fix to an open source project."</p>

<p>To my credit, I did make a very small contribution to Django REST Framework as well as other smaller repositories. Work and personal projects have always gotten the best of me. I’ve since forked projects and made features I’ve needed but I’ve always been too lazy to properly submit pull requests with tests.</p>
<p class="quote">"Do a weekend project and get it on the front page of HN"</p>

<p>In retrospect, it seems silly to make a project with the explicit intention of making the HN front page. No wonder this is the resolution I remember making the least. I suspect many developers have fallen into the same trap, but I have numerous projects that are anywhere from 50% to 80% complete. Shipping products is an art.</p>
<p class="quote">“Read more books: I need to expand my knowledge beyond just reading the news and blogs"</p>

<p>By my count, I’ve read around 18 books since then. Paltry, to be sure, but not nothing.</p>

                   title="Permalink to A little about push">A little about push</a></h1>
<p class="date">Sunday, February 02, 2014</p>        </header>
        <article>
            <p>Last year I had the chance to take some time and get a better understanding of how push notifications work for iOS applications. But before I talk about that, it helps to understand why push notifications exist in the first place.</p>
<p>Apple developed iOS as a closed platform operating system. The source code is mostly closed except for the publicly available portions that developers use in networking programming or to interface with the camera or all the other fancy things that apps do. One of the most important design decisions made at Apple was to heavily restrict the capabilities of daemonized apps (apps running in the background). In fact, Apple's guidelines explicitly state that only apps such as music players, VoIP clients, and GPS navigation systems are allowed to run background tasks. That essentially means that once a user leaves your app, you're dead in the water until the user decides to tap your lovely retina icon again... at least that would have been the case if it weren't for push notifications.</p>
<p>Push notifications exist for the express purpose of letting applications pull users back into their experience. They're basically shouting "Hey, look at me, I have something to show you!"</p>
<p>The life of a push notification starts on an application. The application will ask iOS for a unique device token that identifies the device, sort of like an IP address. As you'd imagine, it's pretty important to know the address of the device you want to send something to. The operating system doesn't have this information regularly, it actually makes a request to the Apple Push Notification Service (APNS), which divulges a unique token for that specific iOS build on that specific device. The application should then pass the token to its backend server (this is the thing that I've been working on at <a href="https://www.myeatclub.com">EAT Club</a>).</p>
<p>Once you want to send a push notification to a specific user (for instance, a "Your food is ready for pickup!" notification that we send to users who have ordered a meal that day), just pluck that device token out of your database table and pass it to your push server to fire off to APNS. There are also third parties that exist as the middle man push server between your backend servers and APNS (see UrbanAirship). While it would be awesome if we could build servers that directly sent out pushes to iOS devices, Apple unfortunately maintains ultimate gatekeeper status and all your push notification requests must be routed through APNS. Such is the plight of developing on a closed source platform.</p>
<p>Then if all is fine and dandy, APNS will send your push to the user's device - along with a custom sound (i.e. the Gmail app), custom alert text, and even let you specify where the user lands when they open the notification (i.e. opening up the Twitter app and immediately dropping you on the tweet that just mentioned your handle).</p>

                   title="Permalink to The Self Aware Python Function">The Self Aware Python Function</a></h1>
<p class="date">Saturday, January 18, 2014</p>        </header>
        <article>
            <p>I've been using Python for over a year now. It's what I learned to program with. About half a year ago, a fellow coder (friend of a friend) posed the following riddle upon learning that it was my language of choice:</p>
<p class="quote">"How would you write a function in Python that knows how many times it's been invoked?"</p>

<p>Let's consider this for a moment. A function that knows how many times it has been invoked is one that would need some access to a scope outside of it's own. Functions are generally pretty transient &mdash; they do their thing and then wait until they are told to do it again. There isn't a middling dormant state where they consider how many times they've been told to execute their (probably) menial task.</p>
<p>As a first stab, we might consider a global counter, as in the following setup:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><span class="n">count</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="mi">0</span>

<span class="k">def</span> <span class="nf">self_aware_function</span><span class="p">():</span>
    <span class="n">count</span> <span class="o">+=</span> <span class="mi">1</span>
    <span class="k">if</span> <span class="n">count</span> <span class="o">==</span> <span class="mi">1</span><span class="p">:</span>
        <span class="k">print</span> <span class="s1">&#39;This is my first time doing this&#39;</span>
    <span class="k">else</span><span class="p">:</span>
        <span class="k">print</span> <span class="s1">&#39;I have done this {} times now.&#39;</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">format</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">count</span><span class="p">)</span>

<span class="k">for</span> <span class="n">i</span> <span class="ow">in</span> <span class="nb">range</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="mi">10</span><span class="p">):</span>
    <span class="n">self_aware_function</span><span class="p">()</span>
</pre></div>


<p>Those familiar with Python are up in arms right now, and rightfully so. Here's what you get when invoking <code>self_aware_function</code>:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span>UnboundLocalError: <span class="nb">local</span> variable <span class="s1">&#39;count&#39;</span> referenced before assignment
</pre></div>


<p>In Python, when you are in a function and assign a value to an immutable type variable (such as our int <code>count</code>), you end up shadowing the global variable with one local to the function's scope. So when <code>count += 1</code> is evaluated (remember this is expanded to <code>count = count + 1</code>), Python cannot find the value for <code>count</code> in the expression to the right of the <code>=</code>.</p>
<h2>Okay, local variables won't work, how about we use the <code>global</code> keyword or mutable variables?</h2>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><span class="c1"># global keyword</span>

<span class="k">def</span> <span class="nf">self_aware_function</span><span class="p">():</span>
    <span class="k">global</span> <span class="n">count</span> <span class="c1"># Now we force the use of the global count</span>
    <span class="n">count</span> <span class="o">+=</span> <span class="mi">1</span>
    <span class="c1"># ...</span>
</pre></div>


<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><span class="c1"># using a list</span>
<span class="n">count</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="p">[</span><span class="mi">0</span><span class="p">]</span>

<span class="k">def</span> <span class="nf">self_aware_function</span><span class="p">():</span>
    <span class="n">count</span><span class="p">[</span><span class="mi">0</span><span class="p">]</span> <span class="o">+=</span> <span class="mi">1</span>
    <span class="c1"># ...</span>
</pre></div>


<p>These both work and globals were my first idea for a solution. However, when I asked if this was acceptable, I was met with opposition.</p>
<p class="quote">"You are only allowed to write code within the function, not outside of it."</p>

<p>That's rough. How do you become self aware of an outside world/scope that you can't even interact with?</p>
<p>Turns out, the answer lies within a popular Python <a href="http://effbot.org/zone/default-values.html">gotcha</a>.</p>
<h2>Self-awareness</h2>
<p>Here's how you define a default parameter in Python:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><span class="k">def</span> <span class="nf">foo</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">default</span><span class="o">=</span><span class="s1">&#39;bar&#39;</span><span class="p">):</span>
    <span class="k">return</span> <span class="n">default</span>
</pre></div>


<p>In Python, default parameters are evaluated ONLY once &mdash; when the function is defined. That means the default parameter is "the same" for all invocations of the function. I say "the same" because normally the default parameter will have the same value across multiple function invocations, but if your default parameter is mutable then you change it! And then you can do some really special things.</p>
<p>Case in point, self-awareness:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><span class="k">def</span> <span class="nf">self_aware_function</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">count</span><span class="o">=</span><span class="p">[</span><span class="mi">0</span><span class="p">]):</span>
    <span class="n">count</span><span class="p">[</span><span class="mi">0</span><span class="p">]</span> <span class="o">+=</span> <span class="mi">1</span>
    <span class="k">if</span> <span class="n">count</span><span class="p">[</span><span class="mi">0</span><span class="p">]</span> <span class="o">==</span> <span class="mi">1</span><span class="p">:</span>
        <span class="k">print</span> <span class="s1">&#39;This is my first time doing this&#39;</span>
    <span class="k">elif</span> <span class="n">count</span><span class="p">[</span><span class="mi">0</span><span class="p">]</span> <span class="o">&gt;=</span> <span class="mi">10</span><span class="p">:</span>
        <span class="k">print</span> <span class="s2">&quot;Who are you to tell me what to do???&quot;</span>
    <span class="k">else</span><span class="p">:</span>
        <span class="k">print</span> <span class="s1">&#39;I have done this {} times now.&#39;</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">format</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">count</span><span class="p">[</span><span class="mi">0</span><span class="p">])</span>

<span class="k">for</span> <span class="n">i</span> <span class="ow">in</span> <span class="nb">range</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="mi">10</span><span class="p">):</span>
    <span class="n">self_aware_function</span><span class="p">()</span>
</pre></div>


<ul>
<li><code>count</code> is evaluated at function definition to be a mutable list with one integer element.</li>
<li>Each invocation of our <code>self_aware_function</code> adds another tick to our mutable <code>count</code> parameter.</li>
</ul>
<p>And we have our cheeky, self aware function!</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span>$ python aware.py
This is my first <span class="nb">time</span> doing this
I have <span class="k">done</span> this <span class="m">2</span> <span class="nb">times</span> now.
I have <span class="k">done</span> this <span class="m">3</span> <span class="nb">times</span> now.
I have <span class="k">done</span> this <span class="m">4</span> <span class="nb">times</span> now.
I have <span class="k">done</span> this <span class="m">5</span> <span class="nb">times</span> now.
I have <span class="k">done</span> this <span class="m">6</span> <span class="nb">times</span> now.
I have <span class="k">done</span> this <span class="m">7</span> <span class="nb">times</span> now.
I have <span class="k">done</span> this <span class="m">8</span> <span class="nb">times</span> now.
I have <span class="k">done</span> this <span class="m">9</span> <span class="nb">times</span> now.
Who are you to tell me what to <span class="k">do</span>???
</pre></div>


<p><span class="note">If you're wondering, mutable default arguments was the answer I gave after a good amount of thought. I believe there are other solutions and I invite you to share them in the comments :)</span></p>

<p class="date">Saturday, June 29, 2013</p>        </header>
        <article>
            <p><span id="note">Learning new <em>nix-craft is kinda like being handed shiny new electronics. You're instantly intrigued with what new stuff you can do with it. This entry is the first in a series about </em>nix-craft.</span></p>
<p>I'm not sure when I first heard of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Symbolic_link">symlinking</a>, but the first time it hit me as "something I should get acquainted with" was while I was reading <a href="http://dotfiles.github.io/">dotfiles.github.io</a>. Context clues provided me with the idea that to symlink was to leave a little note to your OS about where you moved the file it expected to find there.</p>
<p>So, as I had endeavored to clean my virtual <code>$HOME</code> of dotfiles, it became apparent that I needed to get familiar with symlinks.</p>
<h2>Leaving a note</h2>
<p>To create a symlink, you'd type this into your terminal:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span>ln -s path/to/target path/to/link
</pre></div>


<p>In English, this reads as:
Create a symlink at <code>path/to/link</code> that redirects to <code>path/to/target</code>.</p>
<h2>Reading the note</h2>
<p>Most programs play nicely with <code>symlinks</code>. For instance, if you were to symlink your <code>~/.vimrc</code> to <code>~/dotfiles/vim/.vimrc</code>, Vim would access <code>~/.vimrc</code> but would end up reading from <code>~/dotfiles/vim/.vimrc</code> instead. It's kind of like a HTTP 302 that redirects you to another URI, or in our case, another path on your filesystem. Microsoft Windows users might find symlinks to be similar to shortcuts. They're essentially the same thing with the caveat that Windows programs would unfortunately get cranky if you tried to pass the shortcut file as an executable file. In *nix systems, symlinks in place of the actual file is okay for the most part!</p>
<p>It's also helpful to know what path your existing symlinks are pointing to. A simple <code>ls</code> doesn't list out your symlinks. You'll want to run <code>ls -l</code>, and symlinks will look something like the second entry below:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span>-rw-------   1 sitong  staff    28054 Jun 29 17:52 .viminfo
lrwxr-xr-x   1 sitong  staff       33 Jun 29 16:57 .vimrc -&gt; /Users/sitong/dotfiles/vim/.vimrc
</pre></div>


<p><span id="note">I actually ran <code>ls -al</code> since the symlinks in my <code>$HOME</code> are all dotfiles.</span>  </p>
<h2>Removing the note</h2>
<p>Removing the symlink is just an <code>rm</code> to the symlink. For instance:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span>rm ~/.vimrc
</pre></div>


<h2>A little bonus</h2>
<p>So we saw that <code>ln -s</code> is the command for symlinks but what if you passed a naked <code>ln</code> command to your terminal?</p>
<p>You would actually be creating a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hard_link">hard link</a>. Hard links point directly to a file's memory space instead of a filesystem path as with symlinks. This means you can move or rename the target file and the hard link will still resolve to that original target file. If you were to move or rename your symlinked target file then when some program tries to resolve the symlink, it won't find anything at that path. Try it out yourself!</p>

            <p>I set some time out to open the box on some <a href="http://www.python.org">Python</a> fundamentals this weekend. I have a few topics to write about but, for today, let's talk a little about objects.</p>
<h2>Objects</h2>
<p>Objects are a big deal in Python. And rightfully so, as most developers use Python in an object oriented manner, though you can certainly write imperatively or pseudo-functionally too. In fact, some people subscribe to the thought that <a href="http://www.diveintopython.net/getting_to_know_python/everything_is_an_object.html">everything in Python is an object</a>. I'm not going to argue about whether that's true or not so we'll just tip-toe around it and state that there are an <strong>awful lot of objects</strong>.</p>
<p>So what is an object? Let's use <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Object_(computer_science)#Properties_of_an_object">Wikipedia</a>'s definition. Objects are characterized by these properties:</p>
<h4>Identity (Objects are unique from each other)</h4>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><span class="k">class</span> <span class="nc">Trivial</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="nb">object</span><span class="p">):</span>
    <span class="k">pass</span>

<span class="n">obj</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="n">diff_obj</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="n">Trivial</span><span class="p">(),</span> <span class="n">Trivial</span><span class="p">()</span>

<span class="nb">id</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">obj</span><span class="p">)</span> <span class="c1"># 25851216</span>
<span class="nb">id</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">diff_obj</span><span class="p">)</span> <span class="c1"># 26133840</span>
</pre></div>


<h4>State (Can store data in object)</h4>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><span class="kn">import</span> <span class="nn">os</span> <span class="c1"># modules are objects</span>
<span class="n">os</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">my_data</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="s1">&#39;arbitrary&#39;</span>
<span class="k">print</span> <span class="n">os</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">my_data</span> <span class="c1"># arbitrary</span>
</pre></div>


<h4>Behavior (Can manipulate the object)</h4>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><span class="k">print</span> <span class="s1">&#39; &#39;</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">join</span><span class="p">([</span><span class="s1">&#39;strings&#39;</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="s1">&#39;are&#39;</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="s1">&#39;objects&#39;</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="s1">&#39;with&#39;</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="s1">&#39;methods&#39;</span><span class="p">])</span>
<span class="c1"># strings are objects with methods</span>

<h2>Attributes and Methods</h2>
<p>You're probably familiar with setting object attributes to static data or writing simple methods if you've worked with objects in the past.</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><span class="k">class</span> <span class="nc">Lannister</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="nb">object</span><span class="p">):</span>
    <span class="k">def</span> <span class="fm">__init__</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="bp">self</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="n">name</span><span class="p">):</span>
        <span class="bp">self</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">name</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="n">name</span>

    <span class="k">def</span> <span class="nf">say_family_motto</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="bp">self</span><span class="p">):</span>
        <span class="k">print</span> <span class="s1">&#39;{} says: &quot;Hear Me Roar!&quot;&#39;</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">format</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="bp">self</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">name</span><span class="p">)</span>

<span class="n">tyrion</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="n">Lannister</span><span class="p">()</span>

<span class="k">print</span> <span class="n">tyrion</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">name</span>
<span class="c1"># Tyrion Lannister</span>
<span class="n">tyrion</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">say_family_motto</span><span class="p">()</span>
<span class="c1"># Tyrion Lannister says: &quot;Hear Me Roar!&quot;</span>
</pre></div>


<p>But you're actually not limited to such trivial behavior. For instance, since functions are first class objects in Python, you could easily do the following too.</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><span class="k">def</span> <span class="nf">say_common_motto</span><span class="p">():</span>
    <span class="k">print</span> <span class="s1">&#39;A Lannister Always Pays His Debts.&#39;</span>

<span class="n">tyrion</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">say_common_motto</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="n">say_common_motto</span>

<span class="n">tyrion</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">say_common_motto</span><span class="p">()</span>
<span class="c1"># A Lannister Always Pays His Debts.</span>
</pre></div>


<p>As you can see, we've set the <code>.say_common_motto</code> attribute to the function object <code>say_common_motto</code>, then invoked the attribute.</p>
<p>Before we continue, we should make a distinction between <code>.say_common_motto</code> and <code>.say_family_motto</code>.</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><span class="nb">type</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">tyrion</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">say_common_motto</span><span class="p">)</span>
<span class="c1"># &lt;type &#39;function&#39;&gt;</span>
<span class="nb">type</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">tyrion</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">say_family_motto</span><span class="p">)</span>
<span class="c1"># &lt;type &#39;instancemethod&#39;&gt;</span>
</pre></div>


<p>Python resolves the type of <code>.say_common_motto</code> to a function object and <code>.say_family_motto</code> to an instance method object. What's the difference?</p>
<p>You can think of a method as a function with a unique difference. A method always takes the object it's associated with as it's first argument. You don't have a choice on the matter.</p>
<p>Under the hood, when Python sees <code>tyrion.say_family_motto()</code>, it first looks for a <code>.say_family_motto</code> attribute in <code>tyrion</code> (this means you can override an object method by writing to an object attribute with the same name). When it doesn't find that, the interpreter will jump up to the class level and look for <code>say_family_motto</code> function defined at the class level. Once found, it will invoke the function as a method - namely, by attaching the <code>tyrion</code> object to the head of the argument list. That's also why a method definition always includes a positional argument placeholder first (traditionally called <code>self</code> in Python).</p>
<p>Methods are really just a shortcut though. You can actually just define your own function with an argument placeholder for an object and attach the function to the object attribute. An example makes this clearer. Suppose we rewrote the <code>say_common_motto</code> function to make it equivalent to a method.</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><span class="k">def</span> <span class="nf">say_common_motto</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="bp">self</span><span class="p">):</span>
    <span class="k">print</span> <span class="s1">&#39;{} says: &quot;A Lannister Always Pays His Debts.&quot;&#39;</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">format</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="bp">self</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">name</span><span class="p">)</span>

<span class="n">tyrion</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">say_common_motto</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="n">say_common_motto</span>

<span class="n">tyrion</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">say_common_motto</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">tyrion</span><span class="p">)</span>
<span class="c1"># Tyrion Lannister says: &quot;A Lannister Always Pays His Debts.&quot;</span>

<span class="n">tyrion</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">say_family_motto</span><span class="p">()</span>
<span class="c1"># Tyrion Lannister says: &quot;Hear Me Roar!&quot;</span>
</pre></div>


<p>As you can see, defining a method in the class is a lot cleaner than attaching a function to the instance object. But both styles get you to the same resolution eventually. </p>
<p>Anyways, hopefully you know a little more about Python objects now.</p>
