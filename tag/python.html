        <article>
            <p>I set some time out to open the box on some <a href="https://www.python.org">Python</a> fundamentals this weekend. I have a few topics to write about but, for today, let's talk a little about objects.</p>
<h2>Objects</h2>
<p>Objects are a big deal in Python. And rightfully so, as most developers use Python in an object oriented manner, though you can certainly write imperatively or pseudo-functionally too. In fact, some people subscribe to the thought that <a href="http://www.diveintopython.net/getting_to_know_python/everything_is_an_object.html">everything in Python is an object</a>. I'm not going to argue about whether that's true or not so we'll just tip-toe around it and state that there are an <strong>awful lot of objects</strong>.</p>
<p>So what is an object? Let's use <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Object_(computer_science)#Properties_of_an_object">Wikipedia</a>'s definition. Objects are characterized by these properties:</p>
<h4>Identity (Objects are unique from each other)</h4>
<div class="codehilite"><pre><span class="k">class</span> <span class="nc">Trivial</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="nb">object</span><span class="p">):</span>
    <span class="k">pass</span>

<span class="n">obj</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="n">diff_obj</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="n">Trivial</span><span class="p">(),</span> <span class="n">Trivial</span><span class="p">()</span>

<span class="nb">id</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">obj</span><span class="p">)</span> <span class="c"># 25851216</span>
<span class="nb">id</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">diff_obj</span><span class="p">)</span> <span class="c"># 26133840</span>
</pre></div>


<h4>State (Can store data in object)</h4>
<div class="codehilite"><pre><span class="kn">import</span> <span class="nn">os</span> <span class="c"># modules are objects</span>
<span class="n">os</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">my_data</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="s">&#39;arbitrary&#39;</span>
<span class="k">print</span> <span class="n">os</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">my_data</span> <span class="c"># arbitrary</span>
</pre></div>


<h4>Behavior (Can manipulate the object)</h4>
<div class="codehilite"><pre><span class="k">print</span> <span class="s">&#39; &#39;</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">join</span><span class="p">([</span><span class="s">&#39;strings&#39;</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="s">&#39;are&#39;</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="s">&#39;objects&#39;</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="s">&#39;with&#39;</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="s">&#39;methods&#39;</span><span class="p">])</span>
<span class="c"># strings are objects with methods</span>
</pre></div>


<h2>Attributes and Methods</h2>
<p>You're probably familiar with setting object attributes to static data or writing simple methods if you've worked with objects in the past.</p>
<div class="codehilite"><pre><span class="k">class</span> <span class="nc">Lannister</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="nb">object</span><span class="p">):</span>
    <span class="k">def</span> <span class="nf">__init__</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="bp">self</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="n">name</span><span class="p">):</span>
        <span class="bp">self</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">name</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="n">name</span>

    <span class="k">def</span> <span class="nf">say_family_motto</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="bp">self</span><span class="p">):</span>
        <span class="k">print</span> <span class="s">&#39;{} says: &quot;Hear Me Roar!&quot;&#39;</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">format</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="bp">self</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">name</span><span class="p">)</span>

<span class="n">tyrion</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="n">Lannister</span><span class="p">()</span>

<span class="k">print</span> <span class="n">tyrion</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">name</span>
<span class="c"># Tyrion Lannister</span>
<span class="n">tyrion</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">say_family_motto</span><span class="p">()</span>
<span class="c"># Tyrion Lannister says: &quot;Hear Me Roar!&quot;</span>
</pre></div>


<p>But you're actually not limited to such trivial behavior. For instance, since functions are first class objects in Python, you could easily do the following too.</p>
<div class="codehilite"><pre><span class="k">def</span> <span class="nf">say_common_motto</span><span class="p">():</span>
    <span class="k">print</span> <span class="s">&#39;A Lannister Always Pays His Debts.&#39;</span>

<span class="n">tyrion</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">say_common_motto</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="n">say_common_motto</span>

<span class="n">tyrion</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">say_common_motto</span><span class="p">()</span>
<span class="c"># A Lannister Always Pays His Debts.</span>
</pre></div>


<p>As you can see, we've set the <code>.say_common_motto</code> attribute to the function object <code>say_common_motto</code>, then invoked the attribute.</p>
<p>Before we continue, we should make a distinction between <code>.say_common_motto</code> and <code>.say_family_motto</code>.</p>
<div class="codehilite"><pre><span class="nb">type</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">tyrion</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">say_common_motto</span><span class="p">)</span>
<span class="c"># &lt;type &#39;function&#39;&gt;</span>
<span class="nb">type</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">tyrion</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">say_family_motto</span><span class="p">)</span>
<span class="c"># &lt;type &#39;instancemethod&#39;&gt;</span>
</pre></div>


<p>Python resolves the type of <code>.say_common_motto</code> to a function object and <code>.say_family_motto</code> to an instance method object. What's the difference?</p>
<p>You can think of a method as a function with a unique difference. A method always takes the object it's associated with as it's first argument. You don't have a choice on the matter.</p>
<p>Under the hood, when Python sees <code>tyrion.say_family_motto()</code>, it first looks for a <code>.say_family_motto</code> attribute in <code>tyrion</code> (this means you can override an object method by writing to an object attribute with the same name). When it doesn't find that, the interpreter will jump up to the class level and look for <code>say_family_motto</code> function defined at the class level. Once found, it will invoke the function as a method - namely, by attaching the <code>tyrion</code> object to the head of the argument list. That's also why a method definition always includes a positional argument placeholder first (traditionally called <code>self</code> in Python).</p>
<p>Methods are really just a shortcut though. You can actually just define your own function with an argument placeholder for an object and attach the function to the object attribute. An example makes this clearer. Suppose we rewrote the <code>say_common_motto</code> function to make it equivalent to a method.</p>
<div class="codehilite"><pre><span class="k">def</span> <span class="nf">say_common_motto</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="bp">self</span><span class="p">):</span>
    <span class="k">print</span> <span class="s">&#39;{} says: &quot;A Lannister Always Pays His Debts.&quot;&#39;</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">format</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="bp">self</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">name</span><span class="p">)</span>

<span class="n">tyrion</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">say_common_motto</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="n">say_common_motto</span>

<span class="n">tyrion</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">say_common_motto</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">tyrion</span><span class="p">)</span>
<span class="c"># Tyrion Lannister says: &quot;A Lannister Always Pays His Debts.&quot;</span>

<span class="n">tyrion</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">say_family_motto</span><span class="p">()</span>
<span class="c"># Tyrion Lannister says: &quot;Hear Me Roar!&quot;</span>
</pre></div>


<p>As you can see, defining a method in the class is a lot cleaner than attaching a function to the instance object. But both styles get you to the same resolution eventually. </p>
<p>Anyways, hopefully you know a little more about Python objects now.</p>

            <p>In the next couple months, I'm planning on writing more about <code>Javascript</code> as I pick it up in work and from my own reading. Towards the end of <a href="https://www.hackerschool.com">Hacker School</a>, I decided I wanted to explore it as my second programming language. Reasoning: I can return to my functional programming roots and I can round out my understanding of web development by getting intimate with how the browser works.</p>
<p>However, this doesn't mean I will stop developing in <code>Python</code>. Aside from <a href="https://www.djangoproject.com/">Django</a> exposure at work, I'm planning to continue building web applications for myself - and hopefully with more robust front-end UI.</p>
<p>But, that's not quite good enough. If there was one thing I took away from Hacker School, it was the idea that I should always be pushing myself to become a better programmer. Web development is fun and lets me exercise my creative side, but I want to step outside my comfort zone and pursue other avenues of technology too. I'm not entirely sure what direction I'll look but I think my best bet is to attach myself to an open source project and develop a deep understanding of that problem space.</p>
<p>Anyways, I'll think on that and come back with my decision within the next month. Hold me to it!</p>

        <p class="date">Saturday, February 02, 2013</p>        </header>
        <article>
            <p>I'm spending this weekend filling in some of the holes in my programming background, data structures in particular. As part of the learning process, I want to share my new understanding of heaps.</p>
<h2>What is it?</h2>
<p>A heap is a type of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Priority_queue">priority queue</a>, which is just a queue where dequeued elements are primarily selected based on their "priority" and secondarily selected based on the "first in first out" principle. A heap prioritizes by key values of objects it stores, which leads to the two flavors of heaps: the max heap and min heap. The max heap will dequeue the objects with the highest keys first. If there are multiple maxes, the heap will dequeue by order of insertion. As you'd expect, the min heap is the same except it dequeues objects with the lowest keys first.</p>
<h2>Introducing the max heap</h2>
<p>Although a heap is technically a priority queue, and although we are going to implement it as an array, heaps are commonly represented as a binary tree. Here is the max heap we're going to work with:</p>
<p><img alt="Binary max heap" src="http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/1/1c/Heap_delete_step0.svg/500px-Heap_delete_step0.svg.png" /></p>
<p>There are two conditions that must be met for a binary tree to be a max heap.</p>
<ol>
<li>Every parent node must be at least as large as either child nodes. This means the max key will always be at the top of the tree.</li>
<li>The tree must be complete at all levels except the deepest. The deepest level must be populated from the left. This means if the above tree had another node, it would be the left child of the node 8.</li>
</ol>
<p>We're going to implement this heap as an array. This boils down to extracting nodes left to right, top to bottom. Here's what it will look like:</p>
<div class="codehilite"><pre><span class="p">[</span><span class="mi">11</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="mi">5</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="mi">8</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="mi">3</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="mi">4</span><span class="p">]</span>
</pre></div>


<p><span id="note">Normally heaps hold objects with the keys we are showing in the tree and array representation. For simplicity, we'll just assume the objects and keys are one and the same.</span></p>
<p>We also need to keep track of the parent and children of any given node. That's pretty natural for binary trees but how is that implemented in arrays? Turns out it's pretty simple with one-indexing, due to the way we are pulling elements off the tree.</p>
<div class="codehilite"><pre>  <span class="m">1</span>  <span class="m">2</span>  <span class="m">3</span>  <span class="m">4</span>  <span class="m">5</span>  <span class="o">&lt;--</span> One<span class="o">-</span>indexing
<span class="p">[</span><span class="m">11</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="m">5</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="m">8</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="m">3</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="m">4</span><span class="p">]</span>
                             EXAMPLE:
parent<span class="p">(</span>i<span class="p">)</span> <span class="o">=</span> floor<span class="p">(</span>i<span class="o">/</span><span class="m">2</span><span class="p">)</span>            parent<span class="p">(</span><span class="m">2</span><span class="p">)</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="m">1</span>
left_child<span class="p">(</span>i<span class="p">)</span> <span class="o">=</span> i<span class="o">*</span><span class="m">2</span>           left_child<span class="p">(</span><span class="m">2</span><span class="p">)</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="m">4</span>
right_child<span class="p">(</span>i<span class="p">)</span> <span class="o">=</span> i<span class="o">*</span><span class="m">2</span> <span class="o">+</span> <span class="m">1</span>     right_child<span class="p">(</span><span class="m">2</span><span class="p">)</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="m">5</span>
</pre></div>


<p>Let's code up what we have. I prefer to have zero-indexing so the math on the parent/children calculation will have to compensate.</p>
<div class="codehilite"><pre><span class="k">class</span> <span class="nc">MaxHeap</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="nb">object</span><span class="p">):</span>
    <span class="k">def</span> <span class="nf">__init__</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="bp">self</span><span class="p">):</span>
        <span class="bp">self</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">arr</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="p">[]</span>

    <span class="k">def</span> <span class="nf">parent</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="bp">self</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="n">i</span><span class="p">):</span>
        <span class="k">if</span> <span class="n">i</span> <span class="o">==</span> <span class="mi">0</span><span class="p">:</span>
            <span class="k">return</span> <span class="mi">0</span>
        <span class="k">return</span> <span class="p">(</span><span class="n">i</span> <span class="o">+</span> <span class="mi">1</span><span class="p">)</span><span class="o">//</span><span class="mi">2</span> <span class="o">-</span> <span class="mi">1</span>

    <span class="k">def</span> <span class="nf">children</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="bp">self</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="n">i</span><span class="p">):</span>
        <span class="n">left</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="p">(</span><span class="n">i</span> <span class="o">+</span> <span class="mi">1</span><span class="p">)</span> <span class="o">*</span> <span class="mi">2</span> <span class="o">-</span> <span class="mi">1</span>
        <span class="n">right</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="n">left</span> <span class="o">+</span> <span class="mi">1</span>
        <span class="k">return</span> <span class="n">left</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="n">right</span>
</pre></div>


<p>Now, a heap has two basic operations: insert and extract_max (extract_min). These are guaranteed to run in <code>O(logN)</code> time, or in other words, the height of the binary tree.</p>
<h2>Insert</h2>
<p>What does an insert look like in our binary tree model? Following the conditions of a binary heap, we have to insert the new object at the deepest level, moving in from the left. That corresponds to the node marked X below:</p>
<p><img alt="Insert at X" src="http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/a/ac/Heap_add_step1.svg/500px-Heap_add_step1.svg.png" /></p>
<p>It should be pretty obvious that the object we insert could break the heap property of this tree. Whatever key we end up with, we first need to compare it with its parent node. The parent node's key is 8, so if we insert an object with <code>key &lt;= 8</code> then we wouldn't have to do anything further. But what if the key is something higher like 15? Then our insertion would break heap condition #2.</p>
<p>In this situation, the next step is to swap our inserted node with it's parent node. </p>
<p><img alt="Swap with parent" src="http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/1/16/Heap_add_step2.svg/500px-Heap_add_step2.svg.png" /></p>
<p>Cool. But now when we check 15 against its new parent, the root, we notice we're still in trouble. So we swap again. These swap acts are also known as "bubbling up" or "heapifying up", as the inserted object is promoted levels due to its priority.</p>
<p><img alt="Promoted to root" src="http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/5/51/Heap_add_step3.svg/500px-Heap_add_step3.svg.png" /></p>
<p>Now that 15 has made it's way up to the root node, we can stop. As you can see, the new tree follows all conditions to be classified as a max heap. Here's the code for the insert operation.</p>
<div class="codehilite"><pre>    <span class="k">def</span> <span class="nf">insert</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="bp">self</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="n">key</span><span class="p">):</span>
        <span class="bp">self</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">arr</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">append</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">key</span><span class="p">)</span>

<p>As you can see, we first insert to the end of the array, then while the inserted key is larger than its parent, we swap it upward until it finds its place.</p>
<h2>Extract Max</h2>
<p>I believe this is also known as Delete Max, but in either case, this operation removes the max from the heap. And because we're working with a heap, we know the max is the root of the tree (or first element of the array), so we certainly don't need to traverse through the entire structure to determine it.</p>
<p><img alt="Binary max heap" src="http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/1/1c/Heap_delete_step0.svg/500px-Heap_delete_step0.svg.png" /></p>
<p>Now, as mentioned before, the first step is to remove the root node. That leaves us with a tricky situation. What node will replace the root?</p>
<p>Let's go through our options.</p>
<ul>
<li>Pull up the 5. Well, now we fail both conditions. The root is now less than the right child, and more importantly we have an incomplete binary tree.</li>
<li>Pull up the 8. Cool, our root is the max, but now we have an entire empty branch on the right. That seems like a big problem and we can't just fix it by pulling from an entirely separate branch.</li>
<li>Pull up the 3. Breaks the complete tree again.</li>
<li>Pull up the 4. We still have a complete tree (in terms of a heap at least). We have a bad root but maybe we can shift that node back down.</li>
</ul>
<p>So the general solution seems to be, promote the last element of the tree/array.</p>
<p><img alt="Big promotion here" src="http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/e/ee/Heap_remove_step1.svg/500px-Heap_remove_step1.svg.png" /></p>
<p>So now the new root is no longer the max. We need to swap it with one of its children. If we swap with 5, we'll still have the same problem. We'll need to swap with 8. This should lead us to the realization that we'll always want to swap with the higher of the two children, otherwise we'll just be making more of a mess of things.</p>
<p><img alt="Back to normalcy" src="http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/2/22/Heap_remove_step2.svg/500px-Heap_remove_step2.svg.png" /></p>
<p>Now we have our max extracted heap!</p>

<p><span id="note">I'm not actually returning the max here, but you can build that in pretty easily.</span></p>
<p><code>extract_max</code> is a bit more complicated than <code>insert</code>. Swapping the new root down takes a few more comparision steps as we have to decide which child to swap with. We're still within <code>O(logN)</code> time though, since we will never need to swap more than the height of the binary tree.</p>
<h2>So what are heaps good for?</h2>
<p>In general, when you constantly need to access the min or max of some data, heaps are a logical choice, as you just need to pluck it from the top of the tree/front of the array and do a little rearranging. This means they are useful for tasks like managing bandwith on a router (always send the prioritized traffic first) or handling asynchronous event processing (firing off shortest tasks first).</p>
<p>Heaps are also useful in speeding up certain algorithms that require multiple min or max computations. One example is Dijkstra's shortest path algorithm, where you are constantly computing the minimum path for each node.</p>
<p>So, hopefully you've now got a solid understanding of heaps. Next time you're working on something and you find yourself repeatedly taking minimums or maximums, you should give them a try. They will make your life easier.</p>

                   title="Permalink to Bit manipulation fun">Bit manipulation fun</a></h1>
        <p class="date">Wednesday, January 30, 2013</p>        </header>
        <article>
            <p>So while I was working on interview prep, I got a bit curious about what cool ways bit manipulation might alter the way we might write code. Here's a few examples of short functions you can write using only bit operations.</p>
<h2>Simple stuff first</h2>
<p>The following trick may be standard fare but seeing as I am not a "classically" trained programmer (no degree in computer science), this guy did tickle my fancy.</p>
<p>When you write out a integer in a binary representation, 5 as <code>0101</code> for example, the least significant bit (leftmost bit) represents if the integer is odd or even. Of course, bits further left represent powers of two, hence the term "base two".</p>
<div class="codehilite"><pre>0101 <span class="n">is</span> 0<span class="o">*</span><span class="p">(</span>2^3<span class="p">)</span> <span class="o">+</span> 1<span class="o">*</span><span class="p">(</span>2^2<span class="p">)</span> <span class="o">+</span> 0<span class="o">*</span><span class="p">(</span>2^1<span class="p">)</span> <span class="o">+</span> 1<span class="o">*</span><span class="p">(</span>2^0<span class="p">)</span>
     <span class="n">or</span> 0<span class="o">*</span>8 <span class="o">+</span> 1<span class="o">*</span>4 <span class="o">+</span> 0<span class="o">*</span>2 <span class="o">+</span> 1<span class="o">*</span>1
     <span class="n">or</span> 5
</pre></div>


<p>Anyone can write a simple function that tests if a given integer <code>x</code> is even. Usually it will involve checking to see if <code>x</code> mod 2 is 0.</p>
<div class="codehilite"><pre><span class="k">def</span> <span class="nf">is_even</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">x</span><span class="p">):</span>
    <span class="k">return</span> <span class="p">(</span><span class="n">x</span> <span class="o">%</span> <span class="mi">2</span><span class="p">)</span> <span class="o">==</span> <span class="mi">0</span>
</pre></div>


<p>But, given that least significant bit of a binary value represents odd or even, we can write that same <code>is_even</code> function using the <code>AND</code> bit operation. </p>
<div class="codehilite"><pre><span class="k">def</span> <span class="nf">is_even</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">x</span><span class="p">):</span>
    <span class="k">return</span> <span class="p">(</span><span class="n">x</span> <span class="o">&amp;</span> <span class="mi">1</span><span class="p">)</span> <span class="o">==</span> <span class="mi">0</span>
</pre></div>


<p>For example 6 &amp; 1 is 0.</p>
<div class="codehilite"><pre>  <span class="m">0110</span>  <span class="o">&lt;--</span> <span class="m">6</span>
<span class="o">&amp;</span> <span class="m">0001</span>  <span class="o">&lt;--</span> <span class="m">1</span>
<span class="o">======</span>
  <span class="m">0000</span>
</pre></div>


<p>This ends up being the same amount of typing but it's interesting that we have this second option of writing the <code>is_even</code> function.</p>
<h2>Powerful twos</h2>
<p>If you work on <a href="http://projecteuler.net/">Project Euler</a> problems frequently, the following shortcut might be beneficial to keep in mind. Here's a function that checks if <code>x</code> is a power of two.</p>
<div class="codehilite"><pre><span class="k">def</span> <span class="nf">is_power_of_two</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">x</span><span class="p">):</span>
    <span class="n">power_of_two</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="mi">2</span>
    <span class="k">while</span> <span class="n">power_of_two</span> <span class="o">&lt;</span> <span class="n">x</span><span class="p">:</span>
        <span class="n">power_of_two</span> <span class="o">*=</span> <span class="mi">2</span>
    <span class="k">return</span> <span class="n">power_of_two</span> <span class="o">==</span> <span class="n">x</span>
</pre></div>


<p>That's pretty compact but it turns out binary is well suited to figure out if a number is a power of two.</p>
<div class="codehilite"><pre><span class="k">def</span> <span class="nf">is_power_of_two</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">x</span><span class="p">):</span>
    <span class="k">return</span> <span class="p">(</span><span class="n">x</span> <span class="o">&amp;</span> <span class="p">(</span><span class="n">x</span><span class="o">-</span><span class="mi">1</span><span class="p">))</span> <span class="o">==</span> <span class="mi">0</span>
</pre></div>


<p>Let's see this in action with <code>x</code> as some random binary number:</p>
<div class="codehilite"><pre>  <span class="m">010110000</span>  <span class="o">&lt;--</span> x
<span class="o">-</span> <span class="m">000000001</span>
<span class="o">===========</span>
  <span class="m">010101111</span>  <span class="o">&lt;--</span> x<span class="o">-</span><span class="m">1</span>
<span class="o">&amp;</span> <span class="m">010110000</span>
<span class="o">===========</span>
  <span class="m">010100000</span>  <span class="o">&lt;--</span> x <span class="o">&amp;</span> <span class="p">(</span>x<span class="o">-</span><span class="m">1</span><span class="p">)</span>

So<span class="p">,</span> <span class="p">(</span>x <span class="o">&amp;</span> <span class="p">(</span>x<span class="o">-</span><span class="m">1</span><span class="p">))</span> just removed the left<span class="o">-</span>most bit that was equal to <span class="m">1.</span> But then<span class="p">,</span> when might <span class="p">(</span>x <span class="o">&amp;</span> <span class="p">(</span>x<span class="o">-</span><span class="m">1</span><span class="p">))</span> be <span class="m">0</span>? That would only happen when x has only one <span class="m">1</span> bit<span class="p">,</span> which means that x must be a power of <span class="m">2.</span>
</pre></div>


<h2>Swapping in place</h2>
<p>Python is nice in that you never have to use a temporary variable when you want to do variable swaps. This is, of course, not the same in other languages.</p>
<div class="codehilite"><pre><span class="n">x</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="n">y</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="n">y</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="n">x</span>
</pre></div>


<p>Behind the scenes, Python accesses the values of <code>y</code> and <code>x</code>, then rotates them as it unpacks and assigns to <code>x</code> and <code>y</code>. Here's what that looks like when run through the Python disassembler:</p>
<div class="codehilite"><pre><span class="kn">import</span> <span class="nn">dis</span>

<span class="k">def</span> <span class="nf">func</span><span class="p">():</span>

<p>But, did you know we can actually swap without a temporary variable using <code>XOR</code> too.</p>
<div class="codehilite"><pre><span class="n">x</span> ^<span class="p">=</span> <span class="n">y</span>
<span class="n">y</span> ^<span class="p">=</span> <span class="n">x</span>
<span class="n">x</span> ^<span class="p">=</span> <span class="n">y</span>
</pre></div>


<p>To understand what's happening, you should recall that <code>XOR</code> is commutative, <code>x^x</code> is 0, and <code>x^0</code> is <code>x</code>. Let's break down the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/XOR_swap_algorithm">XOR Swap Algorithm</a> again.</p>
<div class="codehilite"><pre><span class="gh">start   -&gt;  breaking down  -&gt;  commuting      -&gt;  cancelling -&gt;  removing 0&#39;s</span>
<span class="gh">=============================================================================</span>
x ^= y  -&gt;  x = x^y
y ^= x  -&gt;  y = y^x^y      -&gt;  y = x^y^y      -&gt;  y = x^0    -&gt;  y = x
x ^= y  -&gt;  x = x^y^y^x^y  -&gt;  x = x^x^y^y^y  -&gt;  x = 0^y^0  -&gt;  x = y
</pre></div>


<p>That's pretty cool but I'll stick to Python's easy swap. It is nice, however, to see how binary manipulation can be used to our advantage in languages that don't have an in-place swap.</p>
<p>Now for the disclaimer. While the XOR swap is pretty nifty, it doesn't have much practical use. If you actually plan on using it in the real world, hopefully your application fits in one of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/XOR_swap_algorithm#Reasons_for_use_in_practice">these</a> buckets. Turns out, optimizing compilers tend to make temporary variable swaps pretty efficient, often faster than this XOR swap.</p>

            <p>You have a complicated problem to solve. How do you start tackling it?</p>
<p>One of the most tried and tested methods of problem solving is nothing more than implementing some noise control. In other words, can you peel back the complexity of the problem and make it simpler?</p>
<h2>Tower of Hanoi</h2>
<p>I finally sat down and tried solving this problem two days ago. For those of you unfamiliar, the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tower_of_Hanoi">Tower of Hanoi</a> is an old puzzle that has been mostly re-appropriated as a classic example of algorithmic thought. Here's a version of it:</p>
<p><img alt="Tower of Hanoi, from Wikipedia" src="http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/0/07/Tower_of_Hanoi.jpeg" /></p>
<p>There are three rods and a number of different sized disks that can slide onto any rod. The puzzle starts with the disks in a neat stack, ascending by size, on the first rod. The objective of the puzzle is to move the entire stack to the last rod, obeying the following rules:  </p>
<ol>
<li>Only one disk may be moved at a time.  </li>
<li>Each move consists of taking the top-most disk from one of the rods and sliding it onto another rod, on top of the other disks that may already be present on that rod.  </li>
<li>No disk may be placed on top of a disk smaller than it.</li>
</ol>
<p>Seems straightforward enough, but let's solve this for N disks. How should we start?</p>
<h2>Let's start with the base cases</h2>

<p>I was pretty excited when I saw this pattern, as it meant I could code up a solution in very few lines of code. Here it is in Python, using a list as a stack:</p>

        <span class="k">return</span>

    <span class="n">solve_hanoi</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">n</span><span class="o">-</span><span class="mi">1</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="n">B</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="n">A</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="n">C</span><span class="p">)</span>

<p>The trick is to redefine the rods for each recursive <code>n-1</code> call. What's more is you really only need to think about which rod you're starting and ending at. The odd rod out is just the buffer.</p>
<p>I'd show you the code in action but all the computation is behind the scenes and not very interesting. Luckily a quick search on Youtube yielded a visual solution for N=6. Notice how there is a point of symmetry in the middle as the 5 smaller disks sit at B and the largest disk migrates over to C. Utterly awesome!</p>

            <p>So, last month, I was working on building test applications for <a href="https://github.com/stoneG/whiskey">Whiskey</a>, my Python WSGI server implementation. I wanted to ensure Whiskey was robust enough to keep going, even if it was serving applications that met critical, program-killing exceptions. To that end, I wrote a random exception throwing application to test with Whiskey. Here's the code, simplified and stripped down to its core.</p>
<div class="codehilite"><pre><span class="kn">import</span> <span class="nn">os</span>

</pre></div>


<h2>A little background</h2>
<p>Whiskey handles concurrent client requests by forking new child processes. Calling <code>os.fork()</code> splits the current process into two, the parent and child. The child process will have a process identifier (pid) of 0. Recall that a forked child process has a copy of the same memory space/environment of its parent.</p>

<p>You might not be surprised since you've already come into this post with some suspicion, but remember that this is the stripped down code. What I actually ran into, was an application that either always failed or never failed. So, what's going on?</p>
<p>Well, every client request leads to a forked child process that handles the request. However, each child process ends up having the same random seed, since it is always forked from the same parent process (or more specifically, a parent process which never changes its random seed). This results in a pesky situation where you unexpectedly have an expected random number.</p>
<h2>Solution</h2>
<p>We need to reset the random seed for each forked process. One way is to set the seed to the time of the request.</p>

<p>Randomness restored.</p>
<p><span id="update">Update</span><br />
My friend <a href="https://twitter.com/geofflee">Geoff</a> mentioned that for real applications, you wouldn't want to use <code>time.time()</code> as your seed. Besides you leaving yourself open to the chance of two requests spawning processes at the same time, any PRNG (pseudo random number generator) is unsuitable for security reasons. Instead using <code>/dev/random</code> (UNIX) or <code>CryptGenRandom</code> (Windows) is preferable, since you'd have true randomness then. For the Python implementation, you'd want to make a call to <code>os.urandom()</code> to access your OS's random file. You can find the documentation on that, <a href="http://docs.python.org/2/library/os.html#os.urandom">here</a>.</p>

        <p class="date">Tuesday, January 08, 2013</p>        </header>
        <article>
            <p>Since I started actively programming a few months ago, I've learned much about what technology I take for granted. In order to help me appreciate the many abstractions that our lives are built upon, I've made it my goal to be more technologically self-sufficent. The first step was to revamp my <a href="http://www.sitongpeng.com">personal website</a>. Next up was to move my code blog from Tumblr to my own domain, and then rebuild it on top of a static site/blog generator. That way, I would have complete ownership and control over my own posts.</p>
<h2>Static what nots?</h2>
<p>Static site generators do what they advertise. They take some content you provide, then generate a pre-determined set of static html pages that are web ready. The idea here is that once you finish setting up the styling and format of your site, you can simply focus on <strong><em>writing content</em></strong>. Of course, they have boiler plate templates ready for you too, if you'd rather jump right into writing.</p>
<h2>Getting set up</h2>
<p>You should certainly consult the <a href="https://pelican.readthedocs.org">Pelican docs</a> for the full guide, but here's my general guide on how to get started.</p>
<p>Pelican is written in Python (major selling point for me), so install it and it's dependencies using virtualenv and pip. Pelican only supports <a href="http://docutils.sourceforge.net/rst.html">reST</a> out of the box but provides <a href="http://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/">Markdown</a> support upon installation of the <a href="http://packages.python.org/Markdown/">Python-Markdown</a> library. I use Markdown for my posts.</p>
<p>Then, you'll want to make a <code>settings.py</code> file somewhere in your project folder. This file will hold the global variables you set for Pelican. The important ones include:</p>
<div class="codehilite"><pre><span class="n">AUTHOR</span> <span class="p">=</span> <span class="s">&#39;YOUR NAME&#39;</span>
<span class="n">SITENAME</span> <span class="p">=</span> <span class="s">&#39;YOUR SITE NAME&#39;</span>
<span class="n">SITEURL</span> <span class="p">=</span> <span class="s">&#39;http://your-site.com&#39;</span>
</pre></div>


<p>For the purposes of setting up a blog on Pelican, you will want to set <code>DEFAULT_PAGINATION</code> to be the (number of posts)/page and <code>DEFAULT_ORPHANS</code> as the largest remainder of posts you'll allow on your last page. For my setup, I selected 5 posts/page, and no more than 3 posts on the last page (so up to 8 posts on the last page).</p>
<p>You can browse over all my selected settings <a href="https://github.com/stoneG/blarg/blob/master/settings.py">here</a>.</p>
<h2>Making it yours</h2>
<p>Now, you can certainly use the <a href="https://github.com/getpelican/pelican-themes/blob/master/notmyidea-cms-fr/screenshot.png">default theme</a> provided by Pelican, or one of their other <a href="https://github.com/getpelican/pelican-themes/blob/master/waterspill/screenshot.png">sample themes</a>, but I prefer to make a theme that suits my own tastes. Reading the Pelican documentation and working through the quickstart guide took up half of my weekend, which means I spent the other half on designing my theme.</p>
<p>You'll need some familiarity with <a href="http://jinja.pocoo.org/docs/">Jinja2</a> templates. At the minimum, you should read about the conditionals/loop syntax (especially loop attributes) and template inheritance (include and block). I believe Jinja2's templating system is similar to Django's, so you should feel at home if that's your forte.</p>
<p>Pelican is specific about what file structure it wants in a custom theme. The <a href="http://docs.getpelican.com/en/3.1.1/themes.html">documentation</a> outlines the structure, but doesn't give you adequate information on what attributes you can access from variable objects. If you need specific functionality beyond what objects and object attributes others have done in the sample themes, you'll probably just need to read through the Pelican source or ask some questions in their IRC channel.</p>
<p>I ended up starting with the default theme (called: notmyidea) templates and stripping it of everything I didn't want to use. For instance, I had no need for the category and author functionalities. I don't want to categorize posts and I'll be the only author on this blog, therefore, I did not supply:</p>
<div class="codehilite"><pre><span class="n">categories</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="n">html</span>
<span class="n">category</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="n">html</span>
<span class="n">author</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="n">html</span>
<span class="n">authors</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="n">html</span>
</pre></div>


<p>Pelican is smart enough to just use it's base templates from the Simple theme if you don't provide all the desired html templates.</p>
<p>You will, however, want to make the basic html frame for your blog and save it as <code>base.html</code>, as all other html templates will inherit from it. Otherwise, use the default theme's templates as a guide for building your custom templates.</p>
<p>Once you have your html templates set, you'll want to work on the CSS, which you will save in <code>static/css</code> folder.</p>
<p>The theme for this blog is <a href="https://github.com/stoneG/blarg/tree/master/themes/sitong">here</a>. Please give me a shoutout in the footer if you want to use it ;).</p>
<h2>Workflow</h2>
<p>So once you have your theme, you're ready to create content! I host my pages on <a href="http://pages.github.com/">Github Pages</a>, but you choose your own host.</p>
<p>Let's go through how I am publishing this post. First I write it (in vim!) and save it in my content folder, which stores all my posts for this year.</p>
<div class="codehilite"><pre><span class="n">content</span><span class="o">/</span>2013<span class="o">/</span><span class="n">trying</span><span class="o">-</span><span class="n">out</span><span class="o">-</span><span class="n">the</span><span class="o">-</span><span class="n">static</span><span class="o">-</span><span class="n">blog</span><span class="o">-</span><span class="n">thing</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="n">md</span>
</pre></div>


<p>I like to move out to the root of my Blog folder, then run Pelican to update all my static pages.</p>
<div class="codehilite"><pre>$ <span class="n">pelican</span> <span class="n">content</span><span class="o">/</span>2013<span class="o">/</span> <span class="o">-</span><span class="n">s</span> <span class="n">path</span><span class="o">/</span><span class="n">to</span><span class="o">/</span><span class="n">settings</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="n">py</span>
</pre></div>


<p>The new static pages will be placed in</p>
<div class="codehilite"><pre><span class="n">output</span><span class="o">/</span>
</pre></div>


<p>but you can always change that path in your <code>settings.py</code>.</p>
<p>Then I simply <code>$ git add .</code> in my output folder, throw on a commit message, then push it to Github.</p>
<h2>Final thoughts</h2>
<p>The entire set up process takes a bit of time, especially if you're making your own theme, but it's always nice to have ownership over your own content. That's just something you don't get on Tumblr or other browser based blogs. Pelican is an awesome option for anyone looking for a static blog generator and wanting to work in Python, I heartily recommend it.</p>

            <p>Pretty odd to have committed to writing 100 meaningful blog posts this year, and then promptly not post until Jan 6th. But as you can tell, my excuse is that I was spending all weekend building my new blog. Well I'm glad to say, <em><a href="http://blog.sitongpeng.com">here it is</a></em>.  </p>
<p>I'm now running on the static site generator, <a href="http://docs.getpelican.com/">Pelican</a>. It's awesome because it is actively developed (version 3.1.1 as of 12/4/12) and it is written in Python, which means I didn't have to default to <a href="http://jekyllrb.com/">Jekyll</a>. It's not that I'm averse to Jekyll, I'd just rather work in the language I'm most comfortable in (<em>not Ruby</em>). Anyways, things I'm most excited about:</p>
<ul>
<li>Writing all my posts in Markdown</li>
<li>Being hosted on Github Pages</li>
<li>Having all my posts saved on my Dropbox</li>
<li>New syntax highlighting color scheme</li>
<li>Actually using my own domain</li>
</ul>
<p>I'm planning on writing about my experience building this blog in a post later this week. Stay tuned.</p>
