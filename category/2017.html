<p>Let's go over my 2016 <a href="/posts/coming-up-in-2016.html">resolutions</a>:</p>
<p class="quote">"Ship something in virtual reality"</p>

<p>I made a scene in VR but nothing worth sharing or shipping. This resolution fell to the wayside since I was waiting for the touch controllers to come out. I also started some work on a 2D project. I might prefer 2D.</p>
<p class="quote">"Write 8 posts worthy of reading"</p>

<p>Well, it sure is rough to have fallen short on the first two resolutions. This one was related to the first, as I was planning on writing about things I learned in VR.</p>
<p class="quote">"Hike at two national parks, preferably new"</p>

<p>Hiked at Arches, Joshua Tree, Banff, Mt. Rainier, Crater Lake. Each park was deeply inspiring in its own way and I continue to feel lucky and humbled upon every visit. To get a feel for what I saw, check out my <a href="https://instagram.com/stoneG">instagram</a>.</p>
<p class="quote">“Live in a foreign country that's new to me"</p>

<p>I spent March living in Budapest. I had an amazing time in that city. Solo travel has shown me how much I care about human relationships. So it's exceedingly ironic that where I expected to find independence, I instead found how I crave the vulnerability of dependence.</p>
<p class="quote">“Develop a fluidity in the kitchen so most dishes I make are served on time"</p>

<p>I prepared somewhere between one to two handfuls of multiple course dinner parties (~6 people each time). And most were ready to go by the time the last guest arrived!</p>
<p class="quote">Be able to name all common herbs & spices by sight & smell"</p>

<p>TBD, I need to test myself and get this on tape.</p>
<p class="quote">"Accomplish at least two physical goals for surfing, snowboarding, skiing, or weightlifting"</p>

<p><em>Surfing</em>: After many youtube videos and lots of trial and error, I'm proud to say I can usually get up on the board, albeit sometimes only briefly before falling. I still need to work on my speed and foot placement.</p>
<p><em>Snowboarding</em>: I definitely progressed from beginner/intermediate to intermediate/advanced levels. I’m good enough to mess around on jumps at the terrain park and I can get some good speed on downhill runs.</p>
<p><em>Bonus physical goal</em>: I went from the couch to a half marathon this year :)</p>
<h2>All in all: 4 to 5 resolutions of 7.</h2>
