        <article>
            <p>Last year I had the chance to take some time and get a better understanding of how push notifications work for iOS applications. But before I talk about that, it helps to understand why push notifications exist in the first place.</p>
<p>Apple developed iOS as a closed platform operating system. The source code is mostly closed except for the publicly available portions that developers use in networking programming or to interface with the camera or all the other fancy things that apps do. One of the most important design decisions made at Apple was to heavily restrict the capabilities of daemonized apps (apps running in the background). In fact, Apple's guidelines explicitly state that only apps such as music players, VoIP clients, and GPS navigation systems are allowed to run background tasks. That essentially means that once a user leaves your app, you're dead in the water until the user decides to tap your lovely retina icon again... at least that would have been the case if it weren't for push notifications.</p>
<p>Push notifications exist for the express purpose of letting applications pull users back into their experience. They're basically shouting "Hey, look at me, I have something to show you!"</p>
<p>The life of a push notification starts on an application. The application will ask iOS for a unique device token that identifies the device, sort of like an IP address. As you'd imagine, it's pretty important to know the address of the device you want to send something to. The operating system doesn't have this information regularly, it actually makes a request to the Apple Push Notification Service (APNS), which divulges a unique token for that specific iOS build on that specific device. The application should then pass the token to its backend server (this is the thing that I've been working on at <a href="https://www.myeatclub.com">EAT Club</a>).</p>
<p>Once you want to send a push notification to a specific user (for instance, a "Your food is ready for pickup!" notification that we send to users who have ordered a meal that day), just pluck that device token out of your database table and pass it to your push server to fire off to APNS. There are also third parties that exist as the middle man push server between your backend servers and APNS (see UrbanAirship). While it would be awesome if we could build servers that directly sent out pushes to iOS devices, Apple unfortunately maintains ultimate gatekeeper status and all your push notification requests must be routed through APNS. Such is the plight of developing on a closed source platform.</p>
<p>Then if all is fine and dandy, APNS will send your push to the user's device - along with a custom sound (i.e. the Gmail app), custom alert text, and even let you specify where the user lands when they open the notification (i.e. opening up the Twitter app and immediately dropping you on the tweet that just mentioned your handle).</p>

        <article>
            <p>I've been using Python for over a year now. It's what I learned to program with. About half a year ago, a fellow coder (friend of a friend) posed the following riddle upon learning that it was my language of choice:</p>
<p class="quote">"How would you write a function in Python that knows how many times it's been invoked?"</p>

<p>Let's consider this for a moment. A function that knows how many times it has been invoked is one that would need some access to a scope outside of it's own. Functions are generally pretty transient &mdash; they do their thing and then wait until they are told to do it again. There isn't a middling dormant state where they consider how many times they've been told to execute their (probably) menial task.</p>
<p>As a first stab, we might consider a global counter, as in the following setup:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><span class="n">count</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="mi">0</span>

<span class="k">def</span> <span class="nf">self_aware_function</span><span class="p">():</span>
    <span class="n">count</span> <span class="o">+=</span> <span class="mi">1</span>
    <span class="k">if</span> <span class="n">count</span> <span class="o">==</span> <span class="mi">1</span><span class="p">:</span>
        <span class="k">print</span> <span class="s1">&#39;This is my first time doing this&#39;</span>
    <span class="k">else</span><span class="p">:</span>
        <span class="k">print</span> <span class="s1">&#39;I have done this {} times now.&#39;</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">format</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">count</span><span class="p">)</span>

<span class="k">for</span> <span class="n">i</span> <span class="ow">in</span> <span class="nb">range</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="mi">10</span><span class="p">):</span>
    <span class="n">self_aware_function</span><span class="p">()</span>
</pre></div>


<p>Those familiar with Python are up in arms right now, and rightfully so. Here's what you get when invoking <code>self_aware_function</code>:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span>UnboundLocalError: <span class="nb">local</span> variable <span class="s1">&#39;count&#39;</span> referenced before assignment
</pre></div>


<p>In Python, when you are in a function and assign a value to an immutable type variable (such as our int <code>count</code>), you end up shadowing the global variable with one local to the function's scope. So when <code>count += 1</code> is evaluated (remember this is expanded to <code>count = count + 1</code>), Python cannot find the value for <code>count</code> in the expression to the right of the <code>=</code>.</p>
<h2>Okay, local variables won't work, how about we use the <code>global</code> keyword or mutable variables?</h2>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><span class="c1"># global keyword</span>

<span class="k">def</span> <span class="nf">self_aware_function</span><span class="p">():</span>
    <span class="k">global</span> <span class="n">count</span> <span class="c1"># Now we force the use of the global count</span>
    <span class="n">count</span> <span class="o">+=</span> <span class="mi">1</span>
    <span class="c1"># ...</span>
</pre></div>


<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><span class="c1"># using a list</span>
<span class="n">count</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="p">[</span><span class="mi">0</span><span class="p">]</span>

<span class="k">def</span> <span class="nf">self_aware_function</span><span class="p">():</span>
    <span class="n">count</span><span class="p">[</span><span class="mi">0</span><span class="p">]</span> <span class="o">+=</span> <span class="mi">1</span>
    <span class="c1"># ...</span>
</pre></div>


<p>These both work and globals were my first idea for a solution. However, when I asked if this was acceptable, I was met with opposition.</p>
<p class="quote">"You are only allowed to write code within the function, not outside of it."</p>

<p>That's rough. How do you become self aware of an outside world/scope that you can't even interact with?</p>
<p>Turns out, the answer lies within a popular Python <a href="https://effbot.org/zone/default-values.html">gotcha</a>.</p>
<h2>Self-awareness</h2>
<p>Here's how you define a default parameter in Python:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><span class="k">def</span> <span class="nf">foo</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">default</span><span class="o">=</span><span class="s1">&#39;bar&#39;</span><span class="p">):</span>
    <span class="k">return</span> <span class="n">default</span>
</pre></div>


<p>In Python, default parameters are evaluated ONLY once &mdash; when the function is defined. That means the default parameter is "the same" for all invocations of the function. I say "the same" because normally the default parameter will have the same value across multiple function invocations, but if your default parameter is mutable then you change it! And then you can do some really special things.</p>
<p>Case in point, self-awareness:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><span class="k">def</span> <span class="nf">self_aware_function</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">count</span><span class="o">=</span><span class="p">[</span><span class="mi">0</span><span class="p">]):</span>
    <span class="n">count</span><span class="p">[</span><span class="mi">0</span><span class="p">]</span> <span class="o">+=</span> <span class="mi">1</span>
    <span class="k">if</span> <span class="n">count</span><span class="p">[</span><span class="mi">0</span><span class="p">]</span> <span class="o">==</span> <span class="mi">1</span><span class="p">:</span>
        <span class="k">print</span> <span class="s1">&#39;This is my first time doing this&#39;</span>
    <span class="k">elif</span> <span class="n">count</span><span class="p">[</span><span class="mi">0</span><span class="p">]</span> <span class="o">&gt;=</span> <span class="mi">10</span><span class="p">:</span>
        <span class="k">print</span> <span class="s2">&quot;Who are you to tell me what to do???&quot;</span>
    <span class="k">else</span><span class="p">:</span>
        <span class="k">print</span> <span class="s1">&#39;I have done this {} times now.&#39;</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">format</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">count</span><span class="p">[</span><span class="mi">0</span><span class="p">])</span>

<span class="k">for</span> <span class="n">i</span> <span class="ow">in</span> <span class="nb">range</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="mi">10</span><span class="p">):</span>
    <span class="n">self_aware_function</span><span class="p">()</span>
</pre></div>


<ul>
<li><code>count</code> is evaluated at function definition to be a mutable list with one integer element.</li>
<li>Each invocation of our <code>self_aware_function</code> adds another tick to our mutable <code>count</code> parameter.</li>
</ul>
<p>And we have our cheeky, self aware function!</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span>$ python aware.py
This is my first <span class="nb">time</span> doing this
I have <span class="k">done</span> this <span class="m">2</span> <span class="nb">times</span> now.
I have <span class="k">done</span> this <span class="m">3</span> <span class="nb">times</span> now.
I have <span class="k">done</span> this <span class="m">4</span> <span class="nb">times</span> now.
I have <span class="k">done</span> this <span class="m">5</span> <span class="nb">times</span> now.
I have <span class="k">done</span> this <span class="m">6</span> <span class="nb">times</span> now.
I have <span class="k">done</span> this <span class="m">7</span> <span class="nb">times</span> now.
I have <span class="k">done</span> this <span class="m">8</span> <span class="nb">times</span> now.
I have <span class="k">done</span> this <span class="m">9</span> <span class="nb">times</span> now.
Who are you to tell me what to <span class="k">do</span>???
</pre></div>


<p><span class="note">If you're wondering, mutable default arguments was the answer I gave after a good amount of thought. I believe there are other solutions and I invite you to share them in the comments :)</span></p>
