<p class="date">Tuesday, May 08, 2018</p>        </header>
        <article>
            <p>This is the first question I had when I first started exploring these subjects a month ago. I have a better grasp on the terms now, so let's delve in.</p>
<p>I think generally when people think about Artificial Intelligence (AI), they think of Artificial General Intelligence (AGI), or the ability of a non-biological entity to be able to successfully perform a wide variety of tasks at a human level (or better) proficiency. This contrasts with narrow AI, which can perform specific tasks at human proficiency. We already have examples of narrow AI in everyday life, like in our personal phone or home assistants, self driving cars, or AlphaGo. We don’t, however, have any examples of AGI yet and there is no consensus as to when that might occur, but the holy grail of AI research is toward the development of human level AGI, with the possibility that super intelligent AI wouldn’t be very far behind.</p>
<p>Machine learning is a field in which machines are trained to develop algorithms to perform a task. This field flies in the face of traditional programming, in which humans assemble the algorithms and program machines to compute them. In machine learning, humans provide the training data (inputs that lead to certain outcomes) and program machines to determine how certain inputs will lead to certain outcomes. This is a powerful paradigm because it frees humans from needing to know how to get to the outcomes themselves, they just need to provide enough training data for a machine to figure out how a certain combination of inputs can lead to an outcome. For instance, if the task at hand is to catch a fish, traditional programming would teach a machine how to use a fishing rod - how to hold the rod, how to release the spool, how to cast a line. Machine learning would give a machine a library of videos showing people succeeding or failing to catch fish, leaving it up to the machine to go through each video and determine/learn how to catch a fish . Perhaps certain casting techniques are better than others, or maybe the weather plays a big role, the machine might pick up on patterns a human doesn't even think consider.</p>
<p>Deep learning is subset of machine learning in which the machine’s learning style is loosely based on the neural wirings of a biological brain. That is, the machine is programmed to replicate how brains learn, via an artificial neural network. I’ll talk about that further in a subsequent post, but these neural networks will have many layers of "neurons" that explore many possible pathways for a set of inputs to end up as a set of outcomes. What's fascinating is that it's very hard to analyze these neural nets since they are essentially a jumble of weights that calculate patterns in input data. Take an artificial neural net (ANN) that can recognize if a cat is in a photo. For humans, we identify cats via features we deem catlike (pointed ear, furry bodies, whiskers). An ANN might notice that some group of pixels relates to some other group of pixels in a way that suggests a cat is there, but to a human this just looks like a bunch of math and data. For all we know, the ANN may come up with a more precise way to recognize cats that no human has ever thought of, some subtle pattern that renders simple feature recognition (it has a cheezburger?) obsolete.</p>
<p>Anyways it's all pretty exciting stuff and I'm looking forward to breaking past my surface level knowledge deep learning, machine learning, and AI. One question answered, many more to go.</p>
<p>Spelling Bee tldr;
Deep learning is a technique in the field of machine learning that advances us closer to creating artificial general intelligence.</p>

        <article>
            <p>It’s been a long time coming, but I’m finally getting around to learning about machine learning. I’m hoping to get a better idea of what artificial general intelligence (AGI) could look like in the future and how that might affect the life I know.</p>
<p>As a first step I’m currently working through Andrew Ng’s <a href="https://www.coursera.org/specializations/deep-learning">Deep Learning</a> course to get my feet wet with some of the technical challenges of machine learning as well as reading Max Tegmark’s <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Life-3-0-Being-Artificial-Intelligence/dp/1101946598/">Life 3.0: Being Human in the Age of Artificial Intelligence</a> to get a grasp on potential big picture ideas about machine learning.</p>
<p>It’s my plan to keep a weekly log of things I’m learning as a way of organizing my thoughts. Wish me luck!</p>

        <article>
            <p><img alt="Torrey Pines State Beach" src="https://raw.github.com/stoneG/stoneg.github.com/master/images/tpstatebeach.jpg"></p>
<p>Let's go over my 2016 <a href="/posts/coming-up-in-2016.html">resolutions</a>:</p>
<p class="quote">"Ship something in virtual reality"</p>

<p>I made a scene in VR but nothing worth sharing or shipping. This resolution fell to the wayside since I was waiting for the touch controllers to come out. I also started some work on a 2D project. I might prefer 2D.</p>
<p class="quote">"Write 8 posts worthy of reading"</p>

<p>Well, it sure is rough to have fallen short on the first two resolutions. This one was related to the first, as I was planning on writing about things I learned in VR.</p>
<p class="quote">"Hike at two national parks, preferably new"</p>

<p>Hiked at Arches, Joshua Tree, Banff, Mt. Rainier, Crater Lake. Each park was deeply inspiring in its own way and I continue to feel lucky and humbled upon every visit. To get a feel for what I saw, check out my <a href="https://instagram.com/stoneG">instagram</a>.</p>
<p class="quote">“Live in a foreign country that's new to me"</p>

<p>I spent March living in Budapest. I had an amazing time in that city. Solo travel has shown me how much I care about human relationships. So it's exceedingly ironic that where I expected to find independence, I instead found how I crave the vulnerability of dependence.</p>
<p class="quote">“Develop a fluidity in the kitchen so most dishes I make are served on time"</p>

<p>I prepared somewhere between one to two handfuls of multiple course dinner parties (~6 people each time). And most were ready to go by the time the last guest arrived!</p>
<p class="quote">Be able to name all common herbs & spices by sight & smell"</p>

<p>TBD, I need to test myself and get this on tape.</p>
<p class="quote">"Accomplish at least two physical goals for surfing, snowboarding, skiing, or weightlifting"</p>

<p><em>Surfing</em>: After many youtube videos and lots of trial and error, I'm proud to say I can usually get up on the board, albeit sometimes only briefly before falling. I still need to work on my speed and foot placement.</p>
<p><em>Snowboarding</em>: I definitely progressed from beginner/intermediate to intermediate/advanced levels. I’m good enough to mess around on jumps at the terrain park and I can get some good speed on downhill runs.</p>
<p><em>Bonus physical goal</em>: I went from the couch to a half marathon this year :)</p>
<h2>All in all: 4 to 5 resolutions of 7.</h2>

<p class="date">Friday, January 08, 2016</p>        </header>
        <article>
            <p>I have a few things to say to the people I met in a city I wasn't sure I would like.</p>
<p><img alt="Toronto at night" src="https://raw.github.com/stoneG/stoneg.github.com/master/images/toronto.jpg"></p>
<p><strong>You</strong>, the pakistani man who makes butter chicken roti at your strangely NYC themed restaurant, who passably decorated it by throwing up old LIFE magazine covers on the walls, who has family trouble in California and a cousin doing a stint in our penal system.</p>
<p><strong>You</strong>, the pupusa lady that gave me an extra tamale on the house after I had such a hard time deciding which pupusas and tamale flavors I wanted to try, who then laughed when I immediately came back to order the fried plantains, which I saw while waiting for my order (they weren't on the menu I agonized over).</p>
<p><strong>You</strong>, the guy bumping to <em>Hotline Bling</em> outside your car that I grooved with, but politely had to decline your offer of a cigarette, because I had gone through D.A.R.E. three times as a kid.</p>
<p><strong>You</strong>, the roommate who was once a kingpin of street fighter arcade sticks as well as an elite Canadian memory champion, who is unfazed by face transplant images that made me jump out of my chair, who upon learning I was leaving Toronto without seeing Niagara Falls rented a car and drove us out there at midnight.</p>
<p><strong>You</strong>, the roommate who is a sound mixing engineer that did a tour of duty in Nashville but somehow managed to work on rock instead of country, who showed me the process for modern sound mixing using Britney Spears’ <em>I'm a Slave For You</em> (dozens of vocal tracks!), who stood in the hallway with me until 3am because we had delved too deep into our opinions about movies &amp; games for sleep to matter anymore.</p>
<p><strong>You</strong>, the roommate who is polyglot that’s lived in many different countries, who works harder to balancing work and school than most anyone I've met, who still had the energy to unabashedly start dancing the one time I casually panned you into my snapchat video.</p>
<p><strong>You</strong>, the girl with an excitement that is palpable, contagious, and hard to forget, who unquestioningly shared your hopes and dreams to a complete stranger who slid into your DMs, who despite living there your whole life, seemed somehow less familiar with directions in Toronto than me.</p>
<p><strong>You</strong>, the guy who has not ventured out of Montreal for over 35 years, but gave me change for the bus and humored me while I chatted you up about how your city's bagels had ruined me for life.</p>
<p><strong>You all made me feel odd, like I was leaving a place that had become a home.</strong></p>
<p>Sincerely,</p>
<p>Confused in California.</p>
